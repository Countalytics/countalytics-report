## Instructions
1. Save Excel data as CSV in the following format (example).
2. Convert CSV to JSON using this tool (https://www.csvjson.com/csv2json), copy-all JSON data and paste into a file called 'consumption.json'.
3. Upload & replace consumption.json in 'docs/assets/' folder with the new JSON file you created.
4. Hard refresh the website or wait for a while for the changes to appear.

### Notes
- Follow the CSV format strictly to ensure all fields and filters work properly.
- Flight filter would show error if selected flight does not correspond with the other filters selected (e.g. ATL, LAX, DL 0843 would lead to an error).
